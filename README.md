# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
This repository contains my SQLALchemy homework for Data Bootcamp.

In this challenge I excercised practice in using SQL Alchemy to pull data from a SQL file and clean it up. I then used flask to create a simple JSON based series of websites. You will find the work using SQL Alchemy in climate_starter.ipynb and the flask app in App.
